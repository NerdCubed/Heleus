# Heleus
##### A Discord bot forked from [Liara](https://github.com/Thessia/Liara) originally by Cassandra and contributors

[![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-3.12-blue.svg)](https://python.org) ![Docker Build](https://github.com/nerdcubed/Heleus/workflows/Docker%20Build/badge.svg)
## So, what is it?
Heleus is a fork of [Liara](https://github.com/Thessia/Liara), and serves the same purpose of providing a framework to build modular Discord bots from.

The purpose of this fork is to provide us with a more up-to-date codebase supporting the latest versions of ~~discord.py~~ disnake, along with modifying, adding and removing various features to better suit our specific needs. Despite that, we hope that it remains useful to other people to use for their own purposes.

One big focus for this bot is Docker support, making it easier to manage dependencies and networking between databases and other services.

## Documentation
As things are under active development, there isn't much documentation in regards to how to use Heleus. If I find the time to write any documentation, then it will be located in the Wiki of this repo.

## Disclaimer
Heleus is under active development, so there might be changes, including large, breaking changes, that are done without any prior notice.
